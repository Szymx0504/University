Encryption protocols are the set of rules setting out how the algorithms should be used to secure information

Popular encryption protocols:

SSL/TLS
Use: Secure websites (HTTPS), web forms, payments
How:
Handshake: Client and server agree on encryption (cipher)
Server Authentication: Server sends its SSL certificate from a CA
Key Exchange: Client verifies certificate, then sends a random string encrypted with the server's public key. Both sides generate a session key
Secure Transfer: All data encrypted with the session key

SSH
Use: Secure remote login, command-line access, file transfers
How:
Connection: Client connects to server
Server Verification: Server proves its identity with a host key.
Secure Channel: A secure, encrypted tunnel is established
Client Login: User authenticates via password or public/private key pair
Session: All commands and data are encrypted

IPsec
Use: VPNs, secure network-to-network connections
How:
Key Exchange (IKE): Devices authenticate each other and negotiate encryption keys
Data Protection: ESP encrypts and authenticates the data packets and AH authenticates packets only (no encryption).
Secure Transfer: Creates a secure "tunnel" for all data between two points on a network.
