##### Part 1: Customers



###### Slide 1: The Universal Pain Point of E-Commerce



Opening:

How many of you have ever rearranged your day for a delivery...  only for it not to come? Or faced the frustration of a 'Sorry We Missed You' card? This, right here, is the multi-billion dollar problem InPost identified and solved.



The Core Problem:

The 'last mile' is the most fragile and expensive part of delivery. For customers, it creates anxiety, inconvenience, and wasted time.



###### Slide 2: Who is the InPost Customer?



While anyone who shops online is a potential user, we can identify key segments based on their primary need:



Segment 1: The Time-Poor Professional

Need: To reclaim control over their time.

Why InPost? 24/7 access means no more waiting at home. Pickup and drop-off happen on their schedule, not the courier's.



Segment 2: The Security-Conscious Urbanite

Need: Certainty and safety for their purchases.

Why InPost? No more parcels left on the doorstep in the rain or stolen. The locker is a secure, personal vault until they collect.



Segment 3: The Value-Driven Shopper

Need: The best deal without hidden costs.

Why InPost? Locker delivery and returns are often free or significantly cheaper than home delivery, making it the default cost-effective choice.



Segment 4: The Eco-Aware Consumer

Need: To align their shopping habits with their values.

Why InPost? Consolidated deliveries to one location cut down on van journeys and CO2 emissions—a powerful ethical selling point.



The magic happens when a user tries it for the first time. The speed, the simplicity, the sheer convenience. It doesn't just solve a problem—it creates a new, better standard for how delivery should work.



(Transition to Company Profile):

So, we've seen the deep-seated customer needs. Now, let's look at the company that was built from the ground up to meet them.



##### Company Profile



###### Slide 3: Company Profile: More Than a Delivery Service



Core Identity:

InPost isn't just a courier company. It's a technology and logistics platform whose entire operating model is engineered for the customer needs we just discussed.



The Strategic Mission:

Their mission is to make e-commerce logistics seamless, efficient, and sustainable—directly answering the demands for convenience, cost-saving, and eco-friendliness.



###### Slide 4: The Engine of Convenience: The Automated Parcel Machine (APM) Network



Opening:

This is their core infrastructure. But the genius isn't just the locker itself; it's the network effect.



Strategic Placement:

Machines are placed in high-traffic, convenient locations like supermarkets and transit stations. This isn't random; it's designed to fit into the customer's existing routine.



The Two-Sided Platform Model:

Side A (B2B): Integrates with online shops (like Amazon, Zalando) via API. This gives them a vast, built-in customer base.

Side B (B2C): Serves the end-user we just described.

The Synergy: The more users, the more retailers join. The more retailers, the more users are attracted. This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle.



###### Slide 5: A Model Built for Growth and Sustainability



Operational Efficiency:

This model is incredibly efficient. One courier can serve dozens of customers in a single stop at a locker bank, drastically cutting costs per parcel—savings that are passed on.



Environmental Credentials:

This efficiency is also the source of their sustainability. Fewer delivery vans on the road means a significantly lower carbon footprint, which we know is a key need for a segment of their customers.
